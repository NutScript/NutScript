## Introduction
NutScript 1.2 is the continuation of the original NutScript framework to provide a better back-end. This should include more efficient code and overall benefits to the way the framework functioned and/or performed.

## 1.1 vs 1.2
1.2 is the more recent and maintained version of NutScript, and it is recommended to use it over 1.1

## 1.2 vs 1.1-beta
For a few years 1.1-beta was the name of the newest and most updated version of NutScript. We are now confident to rename it to 1.2, as the modern stable release of NutScript.
NutScript 1.2 is actively worked on by community developers, and will see numerous new updates and features added.

## 1.2 vs 1.2-wip
the default 1.2 branch will always be the stable release. If you wish to test new releases before they are integrated into the stable branch, you can opt for 1.2-wip. Be aware that 1.2-wip may have bugs and issues.
